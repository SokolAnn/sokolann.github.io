# Hi, I am Anna Sokol

I am a computer science student in my first year at the University of Notre Dame. My research interests lie in the challenges posed by imbalanced data and the application of machine learning algorithms to address them. I am dedicated to developing innovative solutions for handling imbalanced datasets in various domains, such as natural language processing.

Furthermore, I have gained valuable experience working with large language models and I am eager to further investigate the capabilities of these models. My aim is to find new and effective ways to use them to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms.

I am honored to be a part of the esteemed community at Notre Dame, where I have access to top-notch resources and distinguished faculty in the field of computer science. I am passionate about making new breakthroughs and contributing to the growth of the field.
