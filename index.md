# Hi, I’m Anna Sokol

I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working with Prof. Nitesh Chawla in the DIAL Lab. My research combines large language models with knowledge graphs, human evaluation, and community partnerships so that AI systems reflect the needs of the people who rely on them.

Right now I am co-designing language tools with wildlife scientists to accelerate evidence gathering, guiding readers through Colombia’s Truth Commission archives with bilingual navigation support, and documenting evaluation practices that make benchmark reporting more transparent. I love building prototypes with collaborators, pressure-testing them in the field, and translating what we learn into responsible deployment guidance.

Before my PhD, I led analytics and research projects across industry and academia in Russia and the United States. Those experiences continue to shape how I collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, mentor students, and explore the social impacts of AI.
